## Task 1 Details

The purpose of the script is to automate user account creation and permission settings, as well as execute basic administration tasks.

Scripts must be uncompressed from their .tar.gz format before use.

Task 1 has not been fully completed. So may produce some errors. User creation, password restrictions, and shared folder creation is done, however, the shared folders have default permissions, and no users are added to the required groups.

## Task 2 Details

Task 2 is meant to compress a directory to .tar.gz format and send it to a remote server via scp.
